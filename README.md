# Banco de Alimentos Quito – Donation Platform Enhancement

This project addresses three key challenges in the current donation system for Banco de Alimentos Quito (BAQ). The goal is to modernize and optimize the donation experience—both locally and internationally—by integrating robust technologies, simplifying user flows, and providing scalable tools for recurring contributions.

## **Overview**

This solution was developed as part of a hackathon in collaboration with Universidad UTE and Fundación Openlab. It focuses on three core areas:

1. **Optimizing the recurring donation system**
2. **Integrating international donation platforms (e.g., PayPal)**
3. **Improving the existing payment gateway usability and features**
